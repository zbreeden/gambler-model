# Gambler Model

A modular decision model designed to simulate risk-tiered behavior, heuristic overrides, and synthetic persona alignment. Built for strategic targeting, outbound simulation, and portfolio calibration.

## 🔍 Overview

The Gambler operates across three core dimensions:
- **Risk Tiering:** Assigns behavioral weights based on synthetic risk appetite
- **Heuristic Overrides:** Injects rule-breaking logic to simulate edge-case decisions
- **Persona Alignment:** Maps decisions to synthetic archetypes for outbound targeting

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Strategic portfolio simulation
- Synthetic persona testing
- Outbound targeting calibration
- Heuristic stress-testing
